# Hello ASP.NET!

This is a stripped back version of the ASP.NET MVC `dotnet new` starter template

# Changes from the default

- No Bootstrap and stripped back layout
- No jQuery
- Removed "development" mode and "production" CSS filters from the views
- Glitch executes the web app in development mode by default so you see detailed errors

## Your Project

On the front-end,

- Edit `Views/[Controller]/[Action]` to change the content of the MVC pages
- `wwwroot/js/site.js` is the javacript that runs when you load the webpage
- `css/style.css` is the styles for ``Views/[Controller]/[Action]`
- Drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project

On the back-end,

- your app starts at `Program.cs`
- with routes defined in `Startup.cs`
- add nuget packages in `Website.csproj`
- safely store app secrets in `.env` (nobody can see this but you and people you invite)

Click `Show` in the header to see your app live. Updates to your code will instantly deploy.
